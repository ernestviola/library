# Library
A library without persistant storage in which a user can add and remove books.
This project is used in order to learn how prototypes constructors work in
javascript.

## Lessons
I chose to create a table rather than cards because I wanted some more
experience with them. Going down this route was fruitful because I can see how
I would style a table in the future.

I also challenged myself and created a modal which was a lot simplier than
expected.

Lastly I do see the value in using constructors. It made it very easy to test
while building in the form of auto populating books. The book constructor was
also easily extensible and allowed me to finish the last part of the exercise
much faster.
